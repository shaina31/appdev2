Introduction:

The past few years, I was able to work with frontend development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. 
I’d say I’m pretty comfortable with them after spending some ample amount of time to understand them,
 especially when it comes to building user-interfaces and handling how things work on the client-side.

I’ve also had some introductory experience using Firebase, a BaaS platform, for authentication and the likes,
but when it comes to backend development, I don’t have much experience. I may still have remembered some 
basics about databases, but I haven’t really worked hands-on with backend technologies. Some of these 
terms are familiar, while others are completely new.

I am looking forward to learn more in this course. I want to understand how backend development works, 
and how everything runs behind the scenes. I know this will be really helpful, especially with bigger 
projects coming up, like our Capstone Project.


Course Expectations:

In this course, I want to develop a strong understanding of backend development, especially with the 
examples you’ve given us, like Node.js and Express. I know that backend development plays a huge role in 
making applications work efficiently, and I want to learn how to build and deploy APIs since they are 
essential for connecting different parts of an application. Along with that, if given the chance, I also 
want to get hands-on experience working with databases that I usually hear like MongoDB because I know 
how important database management is in backend systems.

Aside from learning technical stuffs, I also aim to improve my problem-solving skills when dealing with
backend-related challenges. I want to be able to understand how everything works behind the scenes, from 
processing user requests to optimizing performance, managing authentication, and handling errors effectively. 
I know that backend development can be complex, but I’m excited to tackle these challenges because I believe 
they will help me grow as a student and an aspiring developer in the future.

Learning backend development will also open up more opportunities for me in the industry. Being able to 
work with both frontend and backend will make me a more well-rounded developer, which is important if I want
to take on bigger projects in the future. I also see this as a crucial step in improving my skills, especially
since we have major projects coming up, like our Capstone Project. I want to be confident in my ability 
to build useful, dynamic, and data-driven applications, and I know that gaining backend development 
skills will help me achieve that.


Challenges and Areas for Improvement:

I can say, the biggest challenge I expect to face in this course is working with databases. To be frank, 
I’m still not that comfortable with SQL or NoSQL databases, so figuring out how to manage data properly 
and understand complex queries might take some time for me. Another thing I think will be tough is handling
API requests, authentication, and security. Since I don’t have much hands-on experience with these, I know 
I might struggle a bit compared to some of my classmates.
 
To get better in these areas, I hopefully plan to practice on my free time by building small projects and 
following tutorials online to reinforce what we learn in class. I also want to make the most of online 
resources and documentation since they can be really helpful when troubleshooting issues occur. Engaging in 
class discussions and asking questions whenever I get stuck will also be a big part of my learning process.
If I run into difficulties, I won’t hesitate to ask for help from my instructor or classmates. I know backend 
development comes with challenges, but I’m willing to put in the effort to improve and gain confidence along the way.


Expectations from the Instructor:

I hope that you still continue to give us clear explanations and real-world examples to help us understand backend 
development better. Having a good mix of theoretical concepts, coding examples, and hands-on exercises would really 
help on  practicing what we learn. I’d also appreciate any extra resources, like recommended readings, write-ups, 
reflections, or practice problems which can help us grasp and deepen our understanding.

Feedback on assignments and projects would be very much appreciated as it is helpful to me as a student because it 
is always good to identify the areas that I am lacking and that I can make some room for improvement for it. 
Guidance on best practices and industry standards would also be valuable, especially since backend development is 
such an important skill in real-world applications.


Final Thoughts:

Just like last time, I am excited about this course and is eager to learn more about backend development. One thing 
that makes it bearable and enjoyable is the environment that our class have already established. I believe that gaining 
backend skills with classmates that are eager to learn and comply will complement the knowledge already imposed to us, 
making us a more well-rounded developer. To sum it all up, I look forward to the challenges and opportunities this course
will bring this semester.

Thanks be to God.
