Being one of the designated Project Managers of our group has been quite a journey. While I didn’t contribute 
in terms of coding and just minimal on designing, I know we played a huge role in keeping the team on track. 
Our job was to manage, guide, and push everyone toward our goals, making sure we stayed productive and focused on our deliverables.

Challenges were unavoidable. When I first stepped into this role, so many thoughts ran through my mind—am I fit for this? Am I capable 
enough? Am I ready to take on this responsibility when I have little to no experience? These thoughts kept bothering me, and honestly, 
I was terrified. I had this belief that if the team failed, it would be on me. After all, I was the one leading them, so if I messed up, 
we’d all be at risk of failing.

But as we got deeper into the project, I realized I needed to change my mindset. If I kept doubting myself, it would only bring the team 
down. Instead, I decided to stay positive because I knew my attitude could affect everyone. And thankfully, we had our instructors guiding 
us along the way, answering our questions and helping us figure things out whenever we got stuck.

When it comes to teamwork, I have to admit—I didn’t expect things to go as smoothly as they did. At first, I was worried that we wouldn’t 
communicate well because of our differences. But surprisingly, it turned out great! Everyone was open to voicing their concerns, opinions, 
and suggestions, which helped us keep the project aligned with our vision. Each team member really stepped up and contributed to their role, 
and when tasks overlapped, they immediately let us know so we could fix things before they become bigger issues. That just showed how much 
everyone cared—not just about passing the subject but also about actually creating something valuable.

As for personal growth, I know I’m not the best Project Manager out there, but I’m always willing to learn. If there’s one thing I’ve realized, 
it’s that communication is everything. The feedback we got from our presentations really opened my eyes to how vital every role is and how strong 
leadership can make a difference. One of my biggest fears has always been leading, and I used to avoid taking on big responsibilities because I 
felt like the pressure was too much. But through this experience, I discovered that I can lead. And that’s a huge deal for me.

God-willing, as this semester progresses, I hope that me and my team will improve more to be able to deliver the project that matches our expectations 
as well as the expectations that our instructors and the panels guiding and teaching us.
